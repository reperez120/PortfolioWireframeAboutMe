        <p>I am currently enrolled in Thinkful’s Full Stack Flex Program. I am actively developing my programming skills through this program, as well as through some independent projects. What I lack in experience, I will make up for in enthusiasm and dedication as I learn and grow on the job.</p> 
        <p>I studied linguistics at the graduate level at Yale University, and enjoy applying syntax analysis methods I learned studying human languages to my work with computer languages. I relish the process of watching a static page come to life and the satisfaction of removing that final bug from a page.</p>
        <p> When I am not working on programming, I enjoy ice skating and dancing, though I do not necessarily do either very well. I further enjoy writing, drawing, and cooking vegan meals, which I do moderately well.</p>
